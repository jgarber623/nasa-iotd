In his painting called _Grissom and Young_, American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell captures technicians helping NASA astronauts [John Young](https://www.nasa.gov/former-astronaut-john-w-young/) and [Gus Grissom](https://www.nasa.gov/former-astronaut-virgil-i-grissom/) suit up for the first flight of the Gemini program in March 1965. NASA loaned Norman Rockwell a Gemini spacesuit to make this painting as accurate as possible.

Since its beginning, NASA has used the power of art to communicate the extraordinary aspects of its missions in a way that connects uniquely with humanity. NASAâ€™s original [art program](https://www.nasa.gov/collaborating-with-nasa/nasa-art-program/), started in 1962 under the direction of Administrator James Webb, included a diverse collection of works from artists such as Rockwell, [Andy Warhol](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/8973491920/in/album-72157633977913266), and [Annie Leibovitz](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/8972299927/in/album-72157633977913266).
