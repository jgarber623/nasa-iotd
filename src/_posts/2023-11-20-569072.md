A funnel-shaped region of space appears darker than its surroundings with fewer stars. It is wider at the top edge of the image, narrowing towards the bottom. Toward the narrow end of this dark region a small clump of red and white appears to shoot out streamers upward and left. A large, bright cyan-colored area surrounds the lower portion of the funnel-shaped dark area, forming a rough U shape. The cyan-colored area has needle-like, linear structures and becomes more diffuse in the center of the image. The right side of the image is dominated by clouds of orange and red, with a purple haze.",

A star-forming region, named Sagittarius C (Sgr C), is seen in exceptional detail in this image from Nov. 20, 2023, thanks to the [Near-Infrared Camera](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/nircam.html) instrument on NASAâ€™s [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov/). An estimated 500,000 stars shine in this image of the Sgr C region, along with [some never-before-seen features astronomers have yet to explain](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-reveals-new-features-in-heart-of-milky-way/).
