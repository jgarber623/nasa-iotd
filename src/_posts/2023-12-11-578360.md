In this image from Dec. 8, 1993, astronaut Kathryn C. Thornton works with equipment during a spacewalk. The spacewalk was part of an 11-day mission, [Servicing Mission 1](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/observatory/missions-to-hubble/servicing-mission-1/), to service the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWpkZVhTa0ljUWEzcDdYc3gzSXlrcHplNWFjd3xBQ3Jtc0trVkRtOUNtR1J1RERVNWFNT3lEX2hSb3JCbWFsUW5QdW1OSW1hMXhCQ016VndSUzIzVW0zRGo2Mi0zZWdFbHdUdm9XTFZ2TWtQUmQ2N0x0VmFNZFlnRWJ4M0hzQmtBcU43V1BNT0ZIZ2VteWNwYzNubw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fnasa.gov%2Fhubble&v=WENo3IwuW7o). Shortly after Hubble was launched in 1990, NASA discovered [a flaw in the observatory’s primary mirror](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/observatory/design/optics/hubbles-mirror-flaw/) that affected the clarity of the telescope’s early images. Fortunately, Hubble’s design allowed astronauts to perform repairs, replace parts, and update its technology with new instruments while in orbit.

Watch [an exclusive interview with Thornton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WENo3IwuW7o&list=PL_8hVmWnP_O34ekuqm3K5ueWfvEVkzJRn), where she shares a firsthand account of the groundbreaking mission, unveiling the challenges, triumphs, and the incredible journey that revitalized Hubble.
