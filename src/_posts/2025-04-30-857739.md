In this photo taken on Feb. 8, 1984, NASA astronaut [Ronald E. McNair](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mcnair_ronald.pdf?emrc=6813316964a01) plays his saxophone while off-duty during the [STS-41B mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/sts-41b/). He and fellow crew members Vance D. Brand, Robert L. Gibson, Robert L. Stewart, and Bruce McCandless II launched on the space shuttle Challenger from NASAâ€™s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Feb. 3, 1984. During the mission, McCandless and Stewart performed the first untethered spacewalks.

McNair, who was nationally recognized for his work in laser physics, was selected as an astronaut candidate in January 1978. He completed a one-year training and evaluation period in August 1979, qualifying him for assignment as a mission specialist astronaut on space shuttle flight crews. STS-41B was his first flight.
