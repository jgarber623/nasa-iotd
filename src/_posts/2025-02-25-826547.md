NASA’s X-59 quiet supersonic research aircraft took another successful step toward flight with the conclusion of a series of engine performance tests. During maximum afterburner testing, a test demonstrating the engine’s ability to generate the thrust required for supersonic flight, the aircraft showed off a phenomenon known as Mach diamonds, seen in this image from Jan. 22, 2025. Mach diamonds, or shock diamonds, appear in the exhaust of supersonic aircraft like the X-59.

The X-59 is the centerpiece of NASA’s [Quesst mission](http://www.nasa.gov/quesst), which seeks to solve one of the major barriers to commercial supersonic flight over land by making sonic booms quieter.
