“HuskyWorks,” a team from Michigan Technological University’s Planetary Surface Technology Development Lab, tests the excavation tools of a robot on a concrete slab, held by a gravity-offloading crane on June 12 at NASA’s Break the Ice Lunar Challenge at Alabama A&M’s Agribition Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Led by Professor Paul van Susante, the team aimed to mimic the conditions of the lunar South Pole, winning an invitation to use the thermal vacuum chambers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center to continue robotic testing. Read more about [NASA’s Break the Ice Lunar Challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/general/california-teams-win-1-5-million-in-nasas-break-the-ice-lunar-challenge/?utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=NASAPrize&utm_campaign=NASASocial&linkId=468107967).
