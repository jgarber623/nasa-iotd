While wearing clean room suits, the [Artemis II crew members](https://nasa.tumblr.com/post/713602179016114176/meet-the-four-artemis-astronauts-who-will-fly) (from left: NASA astronauts Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman, and Christina Koch, and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen) check out their Orion crew module inside the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Aug. 7, 2023. The crew module is undergoing acoustic testing ahead of integration with the [European Service Module](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/artemis-ii-module-makes-a-move). Orion will carry the crew around the Moon in the first crewed mission on NASA’s path to establishing a long-term lunar presence for science and exploration under Artemis.
