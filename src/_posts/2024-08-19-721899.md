An [OSIRIS-REx](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-rex/) sample return capsule training model parachutes down in this image from Aug. 30, 2023. This drop test was part of NASAâ€™s preparations for the return of samples from the asteroid Bennu on Sept. 24, 2023. OSIRIS-REx was the first U.S. mission to collect a sample from an asteroid.
