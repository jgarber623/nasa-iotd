The last rays of an orbital sunset illuminate the cloud tops above the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan, providing a dramatic background for the SpaceX CRS-28 Dragon cargo craft as it approached the International Space Station for docking on June 6, 2023.

The uncrewed Dragon spacecraft carried [scientific experiments and technology demonstrations](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/research-flies-to-the-space-station-on-spacex-crs-28), including studies of plant adaptation to stress and genetic structures called telomeres and deployment of satellite projects designed by students in Canada.
