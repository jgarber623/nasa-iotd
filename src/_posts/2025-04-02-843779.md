  "imageAlt": "The Helix Nebula is a cloud of gas ejected by a dying star, known as a white dwarf. In the composite image, the cloud of gas strongly resembles a creature’s eye. Here, a hazy blue cloud is surrounded by misty, concentric rings of pale yellow, rose pink, and blood orange. Each ring appears dusted with flecks of gold, particularly the outer edges of the eye-shape. The entire image is speckled with glowing dots in blues, whites, yellows, and purples. At the center of the hazy blue gas cloud, is a bright white dot with a pink outer ring, and a smaller white dot.",

This image of the Helix Nebula, released on March 4, 2025, shows a potentially destructive white dwarf at the nebula’s center: this star may have destroyed a planet. This has never been seen before – and could explain a [mysterious X-ray signal](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/x-ray-signal-points-to-destroyed-planet-chandra-finds/) that astronomers have detected from the nebula for over 40 years.

This view combines X-rays from [NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/chandra-x-ray-observatory/) (magenta), optical light data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope (orange, light blue), infrared data from the European Southern Observatory VISTA telescope (gold, dark blue), and ultraviolet data from [GALEX](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/galex/) (purple) of the Helix Nebula. Data from Chandra indicates that this white dwarf has destroyed a very closely orbiting planet.
