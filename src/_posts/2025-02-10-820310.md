Crew aboard space shuttle Columbia captured this image of Mount Everest on Nov. 30, 1996, during the [STS-80 mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/sts-80/). STS-80, the final shuttle flight of 1996, was highlighted by the successful deployment, operation, and retrieval of two free-flying research spacecraft.
