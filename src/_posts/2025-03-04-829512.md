The shadow of Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lunar lander can be seen in this photo from the Moon, taken after landing on March 2, 2025. The lander safely delivered a suite of 10 NASA science and technology instruments; these instruments will operate on the lunar surface for approximately one lunar day, or about 14 Earth days. The successful Moon delivery is part of NASA’s [CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) initiative](https://www.nasa.gov/commercial-lunar-payload-services/) and [Artemis](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis/) campaign. This is the first CLPS delivery for Firefly, and their first Moon landing.
