Types of data are represented in different colors: X-ray data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory is blue and green, optical data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope is yellow, and radio data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array is orange. There is a purple and green bubble-like shape at bottom right. This is a superbubble.",

This image, released on Feb. 12, 2025, is the deepest X-ray image ever made of the spectacular star forming region called 30 Doradus. By combining X-ray data from [NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://www.nasa.gov/chandra) (blue and green) with optical data from [NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) (yellow) and radio data from the [Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/missions/alma/) (orange), this stellar arrangement comes alive.

Otherwise known as the Tarantula Nebula, 30 Dor is located about 160,000 light-years away in a small neighboring galaxy to the Milky Way known as the Large Magellanic Cloud. Because it one of the brightest and populated star-forming regions to Earth, 30 Dor is a frequent target for scientists trying to learn more about how stars are born.
