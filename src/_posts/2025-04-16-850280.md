A scrub jay perches on a branch near the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 22, 2020. Kennedy shares space with the [Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/merritt-island/about-us), which is home to more than 65 amphibian and reptile, 25 mammal, 117 fish, and 330 bird species.

At the time this photo was taken, the [NASA “meatball” logo](https://www.nasa.gov/history/nasas-meatball-logo/) – in the background here – on the Vehicle Assembly Building was being repainted. This iconic building is where the [Artemis launch vehicles are stacked and processed](https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/missions/2025/04/14/nasa-artemis-ii-moon-rocket-gets-new-addition/) in preparation for future missions to the Moon.
