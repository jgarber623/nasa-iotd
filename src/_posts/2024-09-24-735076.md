In this photo from Aug. 7, 2009, [Jose Hernandez](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hernandez_jose.pdf?emrc=66f3ca69e5dca), mission specialist, smiles at the camera as he waits for his turn to enter the space shuttle Discovery as part of [STS-128](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/sts-128/). It was the 128th Shuttle mission and the 30th mission to the International Space Station. While at the orbital lab, the STS-128 crew conducted three spacewalks.

Hernandez joined NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston in 2001. There, he was a materials research engineer in the Materials & Processes branch; eventually, he became branch chief. In 2004, he was selected as an astronaut candidate, and in 2009, he became a crew member of STS-128.
