One of three small lunar rovers — part of a NASA technology demonstration called CADRE ([Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/cadre)) — is [prepared for shipping](https://www.nasa.gov/technology/nasas-mini-rover-team-is-packed-for-lunar-journey/) in a clean room on Jan. 29, 2025, at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. The project is designed to show that a group of robots can collaborate to gather data without receiving direct commands from mission controllers on Earth, paving the way for potential future multirobot missions. The autonomous rovers, plus a base station and camera system, will launch to the Moon aboard IM-3, Intuitive Machines’ third lunar delivery, which has a mission window that extends into early 2026, as part of NASA’s CLPS ([Commercial Lunar Payload Services](https://www.nasa.gov/commercial-lunar-payload-services/)) initiative. The CADRE hardware was delivered from NASA JPL to Intuitive Machines on Feb. 9, 2025.
