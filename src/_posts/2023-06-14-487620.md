In this long exposure photo from June 5, 2023, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket creates a beam of light as it launches from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The 28th commercial resupply mission of the Cargo Dragon spacecraft brought new science investigations, food, supplies, and equipment to the International Space Station, including IROSAs (International Space Station Roll Out Solar Arrays) that will help provide a 30% increase in power for space station research and operations once installed.
