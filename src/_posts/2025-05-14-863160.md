The spiral galaxy known as Messier 81 (M81) has a rosy tint in this June 1, 2007, composite image that incorporates data from NASA’s [Spitzer](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/spitzer/) and [Hubble](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) Space Telescopes, and NASA’s [Galaxy Evolution Explorer](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/galex/). Discovered by the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode in 1774, M81 is one of the brightest galaxies in the night sky. It is located 11.6 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major.

The galaxy’s spiral arms, which wind all the way down into its nucleus, are made up of young, bluish, hot stars formed in the past few million years. They also host a population of stars formed in an episode of star formation that started about 600 million years ago.
