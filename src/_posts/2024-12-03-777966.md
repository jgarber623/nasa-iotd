In this picture from Nov. 15, 2024, Astronaut Suni Williams imitates the tentacle-like arms of the [Astrobee](https://www.nasa.gov/astrobee/) robotic free-flyer in the foreground.

Astrobee robots help astronauts reduce time they spend on routine duties, leaving them to focus more on the things that only humans can do. Working autonomously or via remote control by astronauts, flight controllers or researchers on the ground, the robots are designed to complete tasks such as taking inventory, documenting experiments conducted by astronauts with their built-in cameras or working together to move cargo throughout the station. In addition, the system serves as a research platform that can be outfitted and programmed to carry out experiments in microgravity â€“ helping us to learn more about how robotics can benefit astronauts in space.
