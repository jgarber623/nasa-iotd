A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket carrying NASA’s [Europa Clipper](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/europa-clipper/) spacecraft lifts off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday, Oct. 14, 2024.

Europa Clipper is the first mission designed to conduct a detailed study of Jupiter’s moon Europa to determine if it currently has habitable conditions. The spacecraft will travel 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km) to reach Jupiter in [April 2030](https://europa.nasa.gov/mission/timeline/). It will orbit Jupiter and conduct 49 close flybys of Europa.
