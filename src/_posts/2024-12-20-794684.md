During the morning of March 20, 2015, a total solar eclipse was visible from parts of Europe, and a partial solar eclipse from northern Africa and northern Asia. NASA’s [Terra satellite](https://terra.nasa.gov/) passed over the Arctic Ocean on March 20 at 10:45 UTC (6:45 a.m. EDT) and captured the eclipse’s shadow over the clouds in the Arctic Ocean.

Terra launched 25 years ago on Dec. 18, 1999. Approximately the size of a small school bus, the Terra satellite carries five instruments that take coincident measurements of the Earth system: [Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer](https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/aster) (ASTER), [Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System](https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/ceres) (CERES), [Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer](https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/misr) (MISR), [Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere](https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/mopitt) (MOPITT), and [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer](https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/modis) (MODIS).

On Nov. 28, 2024, one of Terra’s power-transmitting shunt units failed. A response team reviewed Terra’s status and discussed potential impacts and options.  Consequently, the team placed ASTER into Safe Mode.  As a result, ASTER data are not currently being collected. All other instruments continue uninterrupted.
