CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen, second from left, and NASA astronauts Christina Koch, second from right, and Reid Wiseman, right, spoke to a crowd at [SXSW](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/albums/72177720324291313) in Austin, Texas on March 7, 2025. The crew members discussed their mission around the Moon next year aboard Artemis II, the first crewed test flight under NASA’s Artemis campaign. Through Artemis, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars.
