A recovery team member takes part in field rehearsals in preparation for the retrieval of the sample return capsule from [NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission](https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex) in this image from Aug. 29, 2023. The sample of rocks and dust, which the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft collected from the asteroid Bennu in Oct. 2020, will return to Earth on Sept. 24, safely landing at the Department of Defense's Utah Test and Training Range. The sample will give generations of scientists a window into the time when the Sun and planets were forming about 4.5 billion years ago.

[Get a preview of what the asteroid sample recovery will look like](https://blogs.nasa.gov/osiris-rex/2023/07/20/heres-what-asteroid-sample-recovery-will-look-like/) and join us on Sept. 24 at 10 a.m. EDT for [live coverage](https://www.nasa.gov/live).
