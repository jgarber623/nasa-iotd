On June 10, 2023, the Operational Land Imager on [Landsat 8](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/landsat-8/) acquired this image of Mount Taranaki, a snow-capped mountain in New Zealand that is ringed by a dark green forest. Two older and extinct volcanoes, Kaitake and Pouakai, lie to the northwest of its peak.
