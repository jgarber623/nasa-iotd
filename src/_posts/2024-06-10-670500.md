NASA astronaut [Bill Anders](https://www.nasa.gov/former-astronaut-william-a-anders/) took this iconic image of Earth rising over the Moon’s horizon on Dec. 24, 1968. Anders, lunar module pilot on the [Apollo 8](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/apollo-8/) mission, and fellow astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell became the first humans to orbit the Moon and the first to witness the sight pictured.

After becoming a fighter pilot in the Air Force, Anders was selected as an astronaut by NASA. He was backup pilot for the Gemini XI and Apollo 11 flights, and he was lunar module pilot for Apollo 8 – the first lunar orbit mission in December 1968. [Anders passed away on June 7, 2024.](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-administrator-remembers-apollo-astronaut-williams-anders/)
