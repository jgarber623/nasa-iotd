This image from March 8, 2024, shows waveforms of the word “water” in 103 languages etched onto a triangular metal plate. The plate will be attached to the [Europa Clipper](https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft/meet-europa-clipper/) spacecraft, set to fly to one of Jupiter’s moons, [Europa](https://europa.nasa.gov/), after it launches in October 2024.

The waveforms radiate out from a symbol representing the American Sign Language sign for “water.” The [other side of the plate](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA26062) is engraved with U.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón’s handwritten poem [“In Praise of Mystery: A Poem for Europa”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgWbeDNPD6o) and will be affixed with a silicon microchip stenciled with more than 2.6 million names submitted by the public through NASA’s [Message in a Bottle campaign](https://europa.nasa.gov/message-in-a-bottle/join-us/).
