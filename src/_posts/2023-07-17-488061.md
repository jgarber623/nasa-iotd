One of three [specially designed, fully electric, environmentally friendly crew transportation vehicles for Artemis missions](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-fleet-of-vehicles-for-nasa-s-artemis-crews-arrives-at-kennedy) sits at Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 11, 2023. These zero-emission vehicles, manufactured by Canoo Technologies Inc., will take [Artemis](http://www.nasa.gov/artemis) crews on the final Earth-bound leg of their journey to the Moon before boarding their rocket and spacecraft.

The new vehicles are customized to accommodate NASA’s unique specifications for Artemis missions while also paying homage to the legacy of the agency’s human spaceflight and space exploration efforts. Many aspects of the design, from the interior and exterior markings to the color of the vehicles to the wheel wells, were chosen by a creative team that included the Artemis launch director and representatives from NASA’s Astronaut Office based at Johnson Space Center in Houston.
