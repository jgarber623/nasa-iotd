Two black-bellied whistling ducks walk through a field of wildflowers at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on May 19, 2023. The center shares a border with the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge.

Merritt Island's strategic location along the Atlantic Flyway provides a resting and feeding place for thousands of wading birds, shorebirds, and songbirds; more than 330 native and migratory bird species call Kennedy and the wildlife refuge home. Diverse habitats that include brackish marshes, saltwater estuaries, and hardwood hammocks provide homes to an amazing diversity of more than 500 species of wildlife.
