An adult Alamosaurus sports [eclipse glasses](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/safety/#eye-safety-total) outside of The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis, on April 6, 2024. Two days later, the total solar eclipse swept across a narrow portion of the North American continent from Mexico’s Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland, Canada. A partial solar eclipse was visible across the entire North American continent along with parts of Central America and Europe.

The NASA Headquarters photo team chose this image as one of the best from 2024. [See more of the top 100 from last year on Flickr.](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBWE5U)
