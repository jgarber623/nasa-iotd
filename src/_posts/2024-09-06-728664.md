Tiny satellites, also known as [CubeSats](https://www.nasa.gov/what-are-smallsats-and-cubesats/), are pictured after being deployed into Earth orbit from a small satellite orbital deployer on the outside of the International Space Stationâ€™s [Kibo laboratory module](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/japanese-experiment-module-kibo/). The CubeSats were delivered aboard the Northrop Grumman Cygnus space freighter and will serve a variety of educational and research purposes for public and private organizations around the world.
