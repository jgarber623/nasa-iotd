A model of the Mariner-C spacecraft seems to float in the darkness of space in this photo from a June 1964 Conference on New Technology at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland.

Mariner-C and Mariner-D were identical spacecraft designed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to fly by Mars and photograph the Martian surface. Mariner-C was launched on Nov. 4, 1964, but the mission ended unsuccessfully two days later. Mariner-D, or [Mariner 4](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mariner-4/), launched on Nov. 28, 1964, and became the first successful mission to Mars, as well as the first mission to [photograph a planet from space](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/mission_page/MR_Mariner_4_page1.html).
