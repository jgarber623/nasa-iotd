In this image from April 12, 1981, the first space shuttle, [STS-1](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/sts-1/), launches from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida with NASA astronauts [John W. Young](https://www.nasa.gov/former-astronaut-john-w-young/), commander, and [Robert L. Crippen](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/retired-astronaut-bob-crippen-on-the-40th-anniversary-of-sts-1-and-the-beginning-of-the-shuttle-program/), pilot, aboard.

STS-1 was meant to demonstrate a safe launch into orbit and a safe return of the orbiter and crew, as well as verify the combined performance of the entire shuttle vehicle – orbiter, solid rocket boosters and external tank.

The first space shuttle landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California on April 14, 1981, after having successfully tested its major systems.
