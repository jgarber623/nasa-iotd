Expedition 69 Flight Engineer Jasmin Moghbeli captured this image of New Zealand, with its snow-capped Southern Alps mountain range pictured between the partly cloudy Tasman Sea and Pacific Ocean, on Sept. 12, 2023. At the bottom right of the image, one of the International Space Station’s roll-out solar arrays is seen as the station orbited 271 miles above the island nation.

Since the station became operational in November 2000, crew members have produced hundreds of thousands of images of the land, oceans, and atmosphere of Earth through [Crew Earth Observations](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/station-science-101/earth-observation/ "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/station-science-101/earth-observation/"). These photographs record how the planet changes over time due to human activity and natural events.
