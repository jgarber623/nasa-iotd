In preparation for NASA’s [Artemis II crewed mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/), teams at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida practice getting out of the [emergency escape](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/artemis-2/nasa-teams-change-brakes-to-keep-artemis-crew-safe/), or egress, basket on Aug. 9, 2024. The baskets, similar to gondolas on ski lifts, are used in the case of a pad abort emergency to enable astronauts and other pad personnel a way to quickly escape from the mobile launcher to the base of the pad and where waiting emergency transport vehicles will then drive them away.
