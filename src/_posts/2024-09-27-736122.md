The Stanley Cup, won in 2024 by the Florida Panthers, made a visit to the [Vehicle Assembly Building](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/kennedy/kennedy-at-60-vehicle-assembly-building-ready-for-new-era-of-launch-vehicles/) (VAB) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on Sept. 17, 2024, as part of its championship tour.

The VAB currently houses components of the agency’s [Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) mission, the first crewed mission on NASA’s path to establishing a long-term presence at the Moon for science and exploration through Artemis. Artemis II will send four astronauts around the Moon, testing NASA’s foundational human deep space exploration capabilities, the SLS rocket, and Orion spacecraft.
