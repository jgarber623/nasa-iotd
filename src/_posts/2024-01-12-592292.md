The [Operational Land Imager-2](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/landsat-9/landsat-9-instruments/oli-2-design/) on [Landsat 9](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/landsat-9/) captured this image of [Simsbury, Connecticut](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150843/summer-in-connecticut) on September 15, 2022. Martin Luther King Jr. and other students from Morehouse College worked summers on a tobacco farm, Meadowood, in Simsbury in 1944 and 1947 to earn money for tuition. King’s time in Connecticut impacted his outlook and trajectory as a minister and civil rights activist, according to King scholars.
