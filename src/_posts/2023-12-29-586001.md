The [Hubble Space Telescope](https://plus.nasa.gov/video/hubble-the-great-space-telescope/) captured this image of a stellar explosion throwing out sheets of debris in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy on July 7, 2003. Since its 1990 launch, Hubble has changed our fundamental understanding of the universe; with over 1.5 million observations and 20,000+ papers published on its discoveries, Hubble is the most productive [science mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/) in the history of NASA.
