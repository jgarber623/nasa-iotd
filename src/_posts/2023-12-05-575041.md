The Moon, left, Saturn, upper right, and Jupiter, lower right, are seen after sunset from Washington, DC, on Dec. 17, 2020. The two planets drew closer to each other in the sky as they headed towards a [“great conjunction”](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/the-great-conjunction-of-jupiter-and-saturn/) on Dec. 21, where the two giant planets appeared a tenth of a degree apart.
