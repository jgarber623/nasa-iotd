A Rocket Lab Electron rocket stands on Pad B, Launch Complex 1, in Māhia, New Zealand, just ahead of a successful launch on Friday, May 26, with NASA’s Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats (TROPICS) CubeSats payload. Now that the [final pair of CubeSats are in orbit](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-rocket-lab-complete-launch-of-tropics-cubesat-constellation), TROPICS will study the formation and development of tropical cyclones, known as [hurricanes](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hurricanes/main/index.html) in the Atlantic and typhoons in the West Pacific. Hurricane season begins June 1, and the increase of cyclone data collected by TROPICS may lead to improved tropical cyclone forecasts, ultimately helping decision makers and first responders.
