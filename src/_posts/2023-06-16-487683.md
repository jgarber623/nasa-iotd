Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, many enslaved African Americans remained unaware of this executive order for an additional two and a half years. On June 19, 1865, Union troops read out General Order No. 3 at several locations throughout Galveston, Texas, announcing the end of legalized slavery and spreading the news of freedom.

That day of liberation became known as Juneteenth, the oldest known celebration commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. On June 17, 2021, President Joe Biden signed legislation to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.

This image of Galveston was taken by the Expedition 67 crew aboard the International Space Station on June 20, 2022, as it orbited 224 miles above.
