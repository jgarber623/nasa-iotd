In this image from June 2023, an engineer watches a development model rover during a test for NASA’s Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration ([CADRE](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/cadre)) technology demonstration in the [Mars Yard](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-yard/) at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. The team tested a new wheel design, surface navigation software, and mobility capabilities, among other aspects of the project.

NASA is sending a trio of these miniature rovers to the Moon to see how well they can cooperate with one another without direct input from mission controllers back on Earth. About the size of a carry-on suitcase, each of the four-wheeled rovers will drive to find a sunbathing spot, where they’ll open their solar panels and charge up. Then they’ll spend a full lunar day conducting experiments designed to test their capabilities.
