A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying Intuitive Machines’ Nova-C lunar lander (IM-2) soars upward after [liftoff](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/liftoff-nasa-tech-science-en-route-to-moon-with-intuitive-machines/) from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. The lander is set to land on the Moon on March 6.

The NASA science and technology demonstrations aboard the lander will, once on the Moon, gather data to support future human missions. NASA’s [Lunar Trailblazer](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/lunar-trailblazer/) spacecraft, which launched as a rideshare with the IM-2 mission, also began its journey to lunar orbit, where it will map the distribution of the different forms of water on the Moon.
