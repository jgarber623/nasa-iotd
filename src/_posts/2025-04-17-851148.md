The launch of space shuttle [Discovery](https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/space-shuttle-discovery) is captured in this April 12, 1985, photo. This mission, [STS-51D](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/sts-51d/), was the 16th flight of NASA’s Space Shuttle program, and Discovery’s fourth flight.

Discovery carried out 39 missions, more than any other space shuttle. Its missions included deploying and [repairing](https://science.nasa.gov/asset/hubble/house-call-discovery-on-its-way-to-hubble-1999/) the Hubble Space Telescope and 13 flights to the International Space Station – including the very first [docking](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/this-week-nasa-history-discovery-becomes-first-space-shuttle-dock-with-international-space-station-may-29-1999/) in 1999. The retired shuttle now resides at the National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia.
