NASA’s iconic “worm” insignia stands out in this photo taken on Jan. 24, 2025, as engineers and technicians prepared to lift the left center center booster segment for the agency’s [SLS (Space Launch System) rocket](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/). The boosters will help support the remaining rocket components and the Orion spacecraft during final assembly of the [Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) Moon rocket and provide more than 75 percent of the total SLS thrust during liftoff from Launch Complex 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
