Lava encroaches on the Blue Lagoon, a popular tourist destination in Iceland, in this Nov. 24, 2024, [Landsat 9](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/landsat-9/) image overlaid with an infrared signal. The infrared signal helps distinguish the lava’s heat signature.

A volcanic fissure burst open on Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula four days prior, heralded by a series of earthquakes. A plume of gas, consisting primarily of sulfur dioxide, streamed from the lava. The Reykjanes peninsula eruption is the seventh in a [series](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/event/152231/eruption-near-grindavik) of events that began in December 2023.
