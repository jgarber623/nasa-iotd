NASA Astronaut Tracy Dyson points to the [Expedition 71](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/expedition-71/) patch on her flight suit on Wednesday, March 5, 2025. Dyson and her fellow Expedition 71 crewmates Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, and Jeanette Epps answered questions from students at Elsie Whitlow Stokes Community Freedom Public Charter School in Washington.

While aboard the International Space Station, Dyson conducted [dozens of scientific and technology activities](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/iss-research/nasa-astronaut-tracy-c-dyson-scientific-mission-aboard-space-station/) to benefit future exploration in space and life back on Earth. She [remotely controlled a robot](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8678) on Earth’s surface from a computer aboard the station and evaluated orbit-to-ground operations. She operated a 3D bioprinter to [print cardiac tissue samples](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=8741), which could advance technology for creating replacement organs and tissues for transplants on Earth. Dyson also participated in the [crystallization of model proteins](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=9212) to evaluate the performance of hardware that could be used for pharmaceutical production and ran a program that uses [student-designed software](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/investigation/?#id=7856) to control the station’s free-flying robots, inspiring the next generation of innovators.
