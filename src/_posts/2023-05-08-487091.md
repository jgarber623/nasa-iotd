NASA astronaut Stephen Bowen and United Arab Emirates astronaut Sultan Alneyadi (partially obscured) are pictured in their spacesuits, exiting the International Space Station's Quest airlock and beginning a [spacewalk](https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2023/04/28/astronauts-wrap-up-spacewalk-for-station-power-upgrades/) on April 28, 2023. The duo spent seven hours and one minute in the vacuum of space routing cables and installing insulation, readying the orbital outpost for its next set of roll-out solar arrays due to be installed after their delivery on the next SpaceX Dragon cargo mission.
