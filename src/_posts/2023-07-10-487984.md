NASA's [New Horizons](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/overview/index.html) spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Charon, Pluto's largest moon, just before closest approach on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red, and infrared images taken by the spacecraft's Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC); the colors are processed to best highlight the variation of surface properties across Charon.

New Horizons conducted a [six-month-long reconnaissance flyby study of Pluto](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/five-years-after-new-horizons-historic-flyby-here-are-10-cool-things-we-learned-about-plut-0) and its moons in summer 2015, helping us understand worlds at the edge of our solar system, then venturing deeper into the distant, mysterious Kuiper Belt – a relic of solar system formation. The spacecraft is now more than 5 billion miles from Earth and [uses machine-learning AI software](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-team-adds-ai-smarts-to-its-kuiper-belt-object-search) to make searches beyond the Kuiper Belt much faster and more productive.
