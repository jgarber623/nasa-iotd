This April 1, 2018, enhanced-color image of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot was captured by NASA’s [Juno](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno) spacecraft. The image is a combination of three separate images taken as Juno performed its 12th close flyby of the planet.

The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 300 years. In 2021, [findings from Juno](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-juno-science-results-offer-first-3d-view-of-jupiter-atmosphere/?_gl=1*v158kh*_ga*MTA1MDIyMjUxNy4xNzA0NDc0NjA2) showed that Jupiter’s storms are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100 kilometers) below the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350 kilometers).

Juno is a solar-powered spacecraft that spans the width of a basketball court and makes long, looping orbits around [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/). It seeks answers to questions about the origin and evolution of Jupiter, our solar system, and giant planets across the cosmos.
