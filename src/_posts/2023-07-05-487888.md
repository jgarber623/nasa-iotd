NASA’s X-59 research aircraft [moves from its construction site to the flight line](https://www.nasa.gov/aeroresearch/nasa-x-59-moves-closer-to-runway) – or the space between the hangar and the runway –  at Lockheed Martin Skunk Works in Palmdale, California, on June 16, 2023. This milestone kicks off a series of ground tests to ensure the X-59 is safe and ready to fly.

The X-59 is designed to fly faster than Mach 1 while reducing the resulting sonic boom to a thump for people on the ground. NASA will evaluate this technology during flight tests as part of the agency’s [Quesst](https://www.nasa.gov/X59) mission, which helps enable commercial supersonic air travel over land.
