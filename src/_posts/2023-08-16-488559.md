Two ospreys perch in their nest atop a marshalling area sign in front of the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in this photo from June 7, 2023. Kennedy shares a border with the [Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge](https://blogs.nasa.gov/earthdaycountdown/2020/03/16/t-37-protecting-wildlife-at-kennedy-space-center/#:~:text=NASA%E2%80%99s%20Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20in%20Florida%20shares%20its,state-listed%20endangered%20and%20threatened%20animal%20and%20plant%20species.). Merritt Island's strategic location along the Atlantic Flyway provides a resting and feeding place for thousands of wading birds, shorebirds, and songbirds. More than 330 native and migratory bird species, along with 65 amphibian and reptile species, call Kennedy and the wildlife refuge home.
