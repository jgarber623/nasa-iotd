NASA’s [Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera](https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/) aboard the [Deep Space Climate Observatory](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/dscovr/) (DSCOVR) captured the lunar shadow during the Oct. 14 annular solar eclipse. The sensor provides frequent global views of Earth from its position at [Lagrange Point 1](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/what-is-a-lagrange-point/), a gravitationally stable point between the Sun and Earth about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth.

DSCOVR is a space weather station that monitors changes in the solar wind, providing space weather alerts and forecasts for geomagnetic storms that could disrupt power grids, satellites, telecommunications, aviation and GPS.
