A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s GOES-U (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) satellite lifts off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 25, 2024. GOES-U is the fourth and final satellite in the current series of advanced weather satellites; it will provide continuous coverage of weather and hazardous environmental conditions across much of the Western Hemisphere.

In addition to its critical role in predicting weather on Earth, the [GOES series of satellites](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/goes/) helps forecasters predict space weather near Earth that can interfere with satellite electronics, GPS, and radio communications. The GOES-U satellite has a new space weather instrument, the Compact Coronograph-1, which blocks the Sun’s bright light so scientists can observe the relatively fainter solar atmosphere.

GOES-U will take about two weeks to reach geostationary orbit. Once there, the satellite will be renamed GOES-19. [Follow GOES-U’s journey.](https://blogs.nasa.gov/goes/)
