The [Artemis II](http://www.nasa.gov/artemis-ii) crew and teams with NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems Program successfully completed on Sept. 20, the first in a series of [integrated ground system tests](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-kennedy-ready-for-artemis-ii-moon-mission-ground-systems-testing) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in preparation for the upcoming mission around the Moon. NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, along with Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen, practiced the procedures they will undergo on launch day, from putting on [their Orion crew survival system spacesuits](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/orion-suit-equipped-to-expect-the-unexpected-on-artemis-missions/) to traveling to the launch pad and up the mobile launcher, to prepare for their ride to space. Artemis II is the first crewed mission under Artemis and will test all of the Orion spacecraft’s systems with astronauts aboard before future missions to the Moon.
