In this NASA/ESA [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) image, Hubble once again lifts the veil on a famous — and frequently photographed — supernova remnant: the Veil Nebula. The remnant of a star roughly 20 times as massive as the Sun that exploded about 10,000 years ago, the Veil Nebula is situated about 2,400 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. Hubble images of this photogenic nebula were first taken in [1994 and 1997](https://science.nasa.gov/asset/hubble/uncovering-the-veil-nebula/), and again in [2015](https://science.nasa.gov/asset/hubble/veil-nebula-supernova-remnant/).

This view combines images taken in three different filters by [Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/observatory/design/wide-field-camera-3/), highlighting emission from hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms. The image shows just a small fraction of the Veil Nebula; if you could see the entire nebula without the aid of a telescope, it would be as wide as six full Moons placed side-by-side.

Although this image captures the Veil Nebula at a single point in time, it helps researchers understand how the supernova remnant evolves over decades. Combining this snapshot with Hubble observations from 1994 will reveal the motion of individual knots and filaments of gas over that span of time, enhancing our understanding of this stunning nebula.
