During a spacewalk on June 9, 2023, NASA astronaut and Expedition 68 Flight Engineer Woody Hoburg rides the Canadarm2 robotic arm while maneuvering a roll-out solar array toward the International Space Station's truss structure 257 miles above the Pacific Ocean. In the rear, is the SpaceX Dragon crew vehicle that docked to the Harmony module's forward port on March 3 carrying four SpaceX Crew-6 crew members.

The [spacewalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS4z42KaeGk) with astronauts [Steve Bowen](https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/stephen-g-bowen) and [Woody Hoburg](https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/warren-hoburg) of NASA lasted [6 hours and 3 minutes](https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2023/06/09/nasa-spacewalkers-complete-solar-array-installation/). This was the ninth spacewalk for Bowen and the first for Hoburg.
