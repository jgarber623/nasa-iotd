On July 17, 2023, [NASA’s four Starling CubeSats](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/starling) successfully deployed after having launched aboard Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket, shown in this image. NASA sent the team of four six-unit (6U)-sized [CubeSats](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cubesats/overview) into orbit around Earth to see if they’re able to cooperate on their own, without real-time updates from mission control.

The four CubeSats will fly in two different formations to test several technologies paving the way towards a future where swarms of satellites can cooperate to do science in deep space. The [Starling](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft/starling/) mission will last at least six months, positioning the spacecraft about 355 miles above Earth and spaced about 40 miles apart.
