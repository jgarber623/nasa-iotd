In this image from Jan. 12, 2024, NASA astronauts Jasmin Moghbeli (left) and Loral O’Hara pose with a copy of [“First Woman”](https://www.nasa.gov/calliefirst/), NASA’s first graphic novel, inside the International Space Station’s cupola. The interactive graphic novel chronicles the adventures of fictional astronaut Callie Rodriguez, the first woman to explore the Moon. Through Callie’s journey, “First Woman” features real-life technologies developed by NASA to enable future missions [to the Moon](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/), Mars, and beyond. Moghbeli and O’Hara were interviewed by the graphic novel’s writers, and their experiences helped develop Callie’s character.

O’Hara, a former Girl Scout, launched to the space station on Sept. 15, 2023, for a six-month stay. She and her fellow Expedition 70 crew members study an array of microgravity phenomena to benefit humans living on and off the Earth. [Moghbeli](https://www.nasa.gov/people/jasmin-moghbeli/) launched to the International Space Station as Commander of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-7 mission on Aug. 26, 2023. She [returned to Earth with the rest of Crew-7](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJAUetG6C2E?si=zem_ujABAVccn3e3) on March 12, 2024.
