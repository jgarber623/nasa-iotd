The Soyuz MS-26 spacecraft is pictured backing away from the International Space Station shortly after [undocking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXzy9GahNHE) on April 19, 2025. Three hours later, the spacecraft landed in Kazakhstan, returning astronaut Don Pettit and cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner to Earth.

While aboard the International Space Station, Pettit conducted [hundreds of hours of scientific investigations](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/iss-research/science-meets-art-nasa-astronaut-don-pettit-turns-the-camera-on-science/), including research to enhance on-orbit metal 3D printing capabilities, advance water sanitization technologies, explore plant growth under varying water conditions, and investigate fire behavior in microgravity, all contributing to future space missions.
