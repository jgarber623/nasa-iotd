[Landsat 9](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/landsat-9/)’s [Operational Land Imager-2](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/landsat-9/landsat-9-instruments/oli-2-design/) captured this image of the open pits and ponds of [Telfer Mine](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153079/peering-into-the-pits-of-telfer-mine) and the surrounding rust-colored soil on Dec. 15, 2023. The soils have a reddish tint from the iron oxides that have accumulated from millions of years of weathering. This part of Western Australia is known for being rich in natural resources, including petroleum, iron ore, copper, and certain precious metals. Beneath the soils, veins of gold and silver run through sedimentary rocks, such as quartz sandstone and siltstone, that formed about [600 million years](https://doi.org/10.5382/SP.23.11) ago, when much of Australia was under water.
