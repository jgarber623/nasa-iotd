This view of the Earth’s crest over the lunar horizon was taken on July 29, 1971, during the [Apollo 15](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/apollo-15/) lunar landing mission. Astronauts David Scott, Alfred Worden, and James Irwin [launched](https://www.nasa.gov/history/50-years-ago-apollo-15-launches-to-the-moon/) from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a Saturn V launch vehicle.

Designed to explore the Moon over longer periods, greater ranges, and with more instruments for the collection of scientific data than before, Apollo 15 included the introduction of a $40 million lunar roving vehicle (LRV) that reached a top speed of 10 mph (16 kph) across the Moon’s surface.

Upon [landing on the Moon](https://www.nasa.gov/history/50-years-ago-apollo-15-on-the-moon-at-hadley-apennine/) at the Hadley-Apennine site, Scott and Irwin conducted four spacewalks, including three excursions using the LRV, for a combined total of 19 hours. Worden remained in orbit aboard the command module Endeavour.
