Woody Hoburg took this photo of Laguna Verde’s inviting waters as the International Space Station orbited 264 miles (425 km) over South America on July 7, 2023. Laguna Verde, which has an altitude of over 14,000 feet (4,300 meters), is located in the Andes mountains of Chile. Even taller landmarks surround the high-altitude lake, including Ojos del Salado—the tallest peak in Chile and the highest volcano on Earth.
