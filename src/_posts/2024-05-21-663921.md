The island of Hawai’i and surrounding waters glow in unusual shades in this 2022 model made through [NASA DEVELOP](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/capacity-building/develop). The model [was created to help the County of Hawai’i in their shoreline setback plan](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/projects/utilizing-earth-observations-delineate-wetland-extents-model-sea-level-rise). The image shows areas of high flood risk (blue), as well as sea surface temperatures. Orange in the west indicates high temperatures, while red in the east represents low temperatures.

NASA DEVELOP projects bridge the gap between NASA’s Earth science data and society, addressing environmental concerns and enhancing decision-making to improve life here on Earth.
