On June 5, 2023, Crew-5 astronauts Josh Cassada (left) and Nicole A. Mann (second from left) of NASA, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Koichi Wakata (right) visited NASA Associate Administrator Bob Cabana (second from right) at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

Mann, Cassada, and Wakata spent 157 days in space as part of Expedition 68 aboard the International Space Station. While aboard, the astronauts worked on [experiments](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/Crew_5_Research_Highlights) related to heart disease, 3D printing human tissue, and fluid behavior in microgravity.
