NASA launched its [reimagined art program](https://www.nasa.gov/general/nasa-relaunches-art-program-with-space-themed-murals/) by unveiling two murals on Sept. 23, 2024. The murals, titled “To the Moon, and Back,” were created by New York-based artist team Geraluz and WERC and use geometrical patterns to invite deeper reflection on the exploration, creativity, and connection with the cosmos. The vision of this next phase is to inspire and engage the [Artemis](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis/) Generation with community murals and other art projects for the benefit of humanity.

NASA has long used art to tell the story of its awe-inspiring missions. Soon after its inception, the agency started a [formal program](https://www.nasa.gov/history/nasa-and-art/) commissioning artists to develop inspiring pieces like portraits and paintings that highlighted an unexpected side of the agency. In 1962, NASA’s then Administrator James Webb tasked staffer and artist [James Dean](https://www.nasa.gov/general/a-different-perspective-remembering-james-dean-founder-of-the-nasa-art-program/) with implementing the new program, and with the help of the National Gallery of Art, Dean laid the framework to artistically capture the inspiration of NASA’s Apollo program. As the NASA Art Program continues to evolve, the agency remains focused on inspiring and engaging the next generation of explorers – the Artemis Generation – in new and unexpected ways, including through art.
