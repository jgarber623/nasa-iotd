As the International Space Station orbited 259 miles above North Africa, swirls of clouds covered the sky. To the bottom right of the image, one of the station's roll-out solar arrays peeks through. Astronauts aboard the space station see 16 sunrises and sunsets per day due to their high orbital velocity—17,500 miles per hour. In the more than 20 years that people have been living aboard the station, it has circumnavigated Earth tens of thousands of times.
