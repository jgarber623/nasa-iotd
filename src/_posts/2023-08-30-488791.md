As the International Space Station orbited 261 miles above Earth on Aug. 29, 2023, one of the space station’s external high-definition cameras captured [Hurricane Idalia in the Gulf of Mexico](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151767/idalia-roars-into-the-gulf-of-mexico). Hurricane Idalia made landfall over the Big Bend region of Florida on the morning of Aug. 30, 2023, as a category 3 storm. Winds measured 205 kilometers (125 miles) per hour as the storm reached land.
