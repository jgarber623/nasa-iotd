  "imageAlt": "A big spiral galaxy is visible face-on in white/pink colours at the centre of this square astronomical image. The galaxy covers almost the entire image and appears whiter at its centre where more stars are located. Its spiral arms stretch out across the image and appear fainter at the edges. The entire image is speckled with stars ranging in colour from blue to white to yellow/red, across a black background of space. Blue stars are younger and red stars are older. A few of the stars are a bit larger than the rest, with six diffraction spikes.",

This view of spiral galaxy IC 342 is one of five first science images released by the Euclid mission on Nov. 7, 2023. The ESA-led (European Space Agency) Euclid observatory, which will investigate the mysteries of [dark matter and dark energy](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/), is scheduled to begin regular science operations in early 2024.

NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California [delivered critical hardware](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-delivers-detectors-for-esas-euclid-spacecraft) for one of the Euclid spacecraft’s instruments. In addition, NASA has established a U.S.-based Euclid science data center, and NASA-funded science teams will join other Euclid scientists in studying dark energy, galaxy evolution, and dark matter.
