The waxing gibbous Moon stands out against the stark darkness of space on May 3, 2023. This image was taken from the International Space Station as it orbited 268 miles above the southern Atlantic Ocean. During the waxing gibbous phase, most of the Moon is visible and it appears brighter in the sky.
