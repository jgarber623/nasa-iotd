The space shuttle [Columbia](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/flights-columbia-03.pdf?emrc=668cca9a5dea0) launches from Pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 8, 1994. This was the second flight of International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2), carrying more than twice the number of experiments and facilities as [IML-1](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/this-week-nasa-history-first-international-microgravity-laboratory-launches-jan-22-1992/). The crew split into two teams to perform around-the-clock research. More than 80 experiments, representing more than 200 scientists from six space agencies, were in the Spacelab module. Fifty of these experiments delved into life sciences, including bioprocessing, space biology, human physiology, and radiation biology.

[STS-65](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/sts-65/)’s crew included NASA astronauts [Robert D. Cabana](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cabana_robert.pdf?emrc=668cca9a5e51f), [James D. Halsell Jr.](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/halsell_james.pdf?emrc=668cca9a5e705), [Richard J. Hieb](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hieb.pdf?emrc=668cca9a5e85f), [Carl E. Walz](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/walz_carl.pdf?emrc=668cca9a5e9ec), [Leroy Chiao](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/chiao_leroy_0.pdf?emrc=668cca9a5eb2b), and [Donald A. Thomas](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/thomas_donald.pdf?emrc=668cca9a5ecdf), as well as National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan astronaut [Chiaki Naito-Mukai](https://humans-in-space.jaxa.jp/en/astronaut/mukai-chiaki/). On this flight, Naito-Mukai became the first Japanese woman in space.
