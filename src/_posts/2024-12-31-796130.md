Peering through the window of the SpaceX Dragon Endeavour spacecraft, NASA astronaut [Matthew Dominick](https://www.nasa.gov/people/matthew-dominick/) captured this image on Oct. 7, 2024 of the SpaceX Dragon Freedom spacecraft as vivid green and pink [aurora](https://science.nasa.gov/feature/nasas-guide-to-finding-and-photographing-auroras/) swirled through Earth’s atmosphere while the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/) soared 273 miles above the Indian Ocean.

Visit [Dominick’s photography on station](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/matt-dominicks-x-account-a-visual-journey-from-space/) to experience the wonders of space through his eyes, enriched by his remarkable journey of orbiting the Earth 3,760 times.
