Employees at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida and NASA astronaut [Victor Glover](https://www.nasa.gov/people/victor-j-glover-jr/) (right) happily snap a photo of themselves during a visit on Nov. 8, 2024. The employees are part of the agency’s [Exploration Ground Systems](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/exploration-ground-systems/) (EGS), which develops and operates the systems and facilities needed to process and launch rockets and spacecraft for NASA’s Artemis missions. EGS plays a primary role in assembly, launch, and recovery of rockets and spacecraft.
