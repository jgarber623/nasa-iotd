At right and at middle bottom, two small dots can be seen: they are two of Saturn's moons - Mimas and Enceladus, respectively. Saturn itself takes on a reddish tint in its northern hemisphere and blue at its bottom. The planet's concentric rings are an icy white.",

NASA’s [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) captured this [image of Saturn and its colossal rings](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubble-sees-summertime-on-saturn/) on July 4, 2020, during summer in the gas giant’s northern hemisphere. Two of Saturn’s icy moons are also clearly visible: Mimas at right, and Enceladus at bottom. 

The light reddish haze over the northern hemisphere seen in this color composite could be due to heating from increased sunlight, which could either change the atmospheric circulation or remove ices from aerosols in the atmosphere. Another theory is that the increased sunlight in the summer months is changing the amounts of photochemical haze produced. Conversely, the just-now-visible south pole has a blue hue, reflecting changes in Saturn’s winter hemisphere.

This image was taken as part of the [Outer Planets Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) project](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13783). OPAL is helping scientists understand the atmospheric dynamics and evolution of our solar system’s gas giant planets. In Saturn’s case, astronomers continue tracking shifting weather patterns and storms.
