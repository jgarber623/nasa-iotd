An engineer prepares a small rover for testing in a thermal vacuum chamber on Oct. 24, 2023, at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. This rover is part of the agency’s [Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/cadre) (CADRE) technology demonstration that’s headed to the Moon as part of the [Commercial Lunar Payload Services](https://science.nasa.gov/lunar-science/deliveries/cp-11/) initiative. CADRE is designed to demonstrate that multiple robots can cooperate and explore together autonomously – without direct input from human mission controllers.
