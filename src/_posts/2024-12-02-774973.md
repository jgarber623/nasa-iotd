Technicians guide the equipment that will house Gateway’s xenon and liquid fuel tanks in this photo from July 1, 2024. The tanks are part of [Gateway’s](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/gateway/) [Power and Propulsion Element](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/a-powerhouse-in-deep-space-gateways-power-and-propulsion-element/), which will make the lunar space station the most powerful solar electric spacecraft ever flown. Once fully assembled and launched to lunar orbit, the Power and Propulsion Element’s roll-out solar arrays will harness the Sun’s energy to energize xenon gas and produce the thrust to get Gateway to the Moon’s orbit where it will await the arrival of its first crew on the [Artemis IV mission.](https://www.nasa.gov/general/nasas-artemis-iv-building-first-lunar-space-station/)
