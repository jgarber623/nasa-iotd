Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) passes over NASAâ€™s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans in this Oct. 13, 2024, image. This comet comes from the Oort Cloud, far beyond Pluto and the most distant edges of the Kuiper Belt. Though Comet C/2023 A3 will be visible through early November, the [best time to observe](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-october-2024-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/) is between now and Oct. 24.
