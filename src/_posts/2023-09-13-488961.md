Justin Hall lands the Dryden Remotely Operated Integrated Drone 2 (DROID 2) aircraft at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, on Aug. 22, 2023, as part of the [Advanced Exploration of Reliable Operation at Low Altitudes: Meteorology, Simulation and Technology campaign](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-armstrong-supports-wind-study). The data gathered by studying wind from the ground to 2,000 feetÂ could improve the safety of takeoff and landing for future air taxis and improve weather forecasts.

DROID 2, a fixed wing aircraft, acted as a wind sensor during the study. The remotely piloted drone, with its 10-foot wingspan, flew repeated passes at different predetermined altitudes. It completed the last flights for the campaign on Aug. 31.
