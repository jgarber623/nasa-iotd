On July 16, 2024, the first core stage of NASA’s [SLS](http://www.nasa.gov/sls) (Space Launch System) rocket for the agency’s Artemis II mission [began a journey](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-ships-moon-rocket-stage-ahead-of-first-crewed-artemis-flight/) from [NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility](https://www.nasa.gov/michoud-assembly-facility/) in New Orleans. The core stage was moved onto the agency’s Pegasus barge, where it will be ferried 900 miles to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Once at Kennedy, engineers will prepare it in the Vehicle Assembly Building for attachment to other rocket and [Orion](http://www.nasa.gov/orion) spacecraft elements.

The [SLS rocket’s core stage](https://nasa.tumblr.com/post/755645205384953856/the-sls-space-launch-system-core-stage-by) is the largest NASA has ever produced. At 212 feet tall, it consists of five major elements, including two huge propellant tanks that collectively hold more than 733,000 gallons of super-chilled liquid propellant to feed four RS-25 engines. During launch and flight, the stage will operate for just over eight minutes, producing more than 2 million pounds of thrust to propel four astronauts inside NASA’s Orion spacecraft toward the Moon.
