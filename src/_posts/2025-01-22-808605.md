Two astronauts are seated inside the Gemini spacecraft in this artist’s concept made in January 1965. The [Gemini program](https://www.nasa.gov/gemini/) was an early NASA human spaceflight program designed to bridge the Mercury and [Apollo](https://www.nasa.gov/the-apollo-program/) programs. Its main goal was to test equipment and mission procedures in Earth orbit and to train astronauts and ground crew for future Apollo missions. The first two Gemini missions were uncrewed; crew members flew on the 10 following missions.
