NASA astronaut [Alan Bean](https://www.nasa.gov/former-astronaut-alan-bean/) steps off the lunar module ladder in this photo from Nov. 19, 1969, joining astronaut [Charles Conrad Jr.](https://www.nasa.gov/former-astronaut-charles-pete-conrad-jr/) on the Moon in the area called the Ocean of Storms. The two would then complete two spacewalks on the lunar surface, deploying science instruments, collecting geology samples, and inspecting the Surveyor 3 spacecraft, which had landed in the same area. While Bean and Conrad worked on the Moon, astronaut [Richard F. Gordon](https://www.nasa.gov/former-astronaut-richard-f-gordon-jr/) completed science from lunar orbit.
