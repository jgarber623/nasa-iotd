In this image from May 4, 2017, a rabbit is nearly obscured by grass at NASA’s [Kennedy Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/kennedy/) in Florida. Kennedy shares a border with the Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge, which is home to over 31 mammal species and hundreds of bird, fish, amphibian, and reptile species. Kennedy is responsible for more protected species than any other federal property in the continental United States, and there are diverse and varied [efforts](https://blogs.nasa.gov/earthdaycountdown/2020/03/16/t-37-protecting-wildlife-at-kennedy-space-center/#:~:text=NASA%E2%80%99s%20Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20in%20Florida%20shares%20its,state-listed%20endangered%20and%20threatened%20animal%20and%20plant%20species.) to protect and preserve ecological systems at the center while simultaneously supporting the NASA mission.
