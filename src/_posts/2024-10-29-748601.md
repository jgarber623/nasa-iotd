Landsat 8’s Operational Land Imager acquired this image of an elongated [lenticular cloud](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153312/marvelous-lenticularis), locally nicknamed the “Taieri Pet,” above New Zealand’s South Island on Sept. 7, 2024. Lenticular clouds form when prevailing winds encounter a topographic barrier, such as a mountain range. Wind that is forced to flow up and over the mountains creates a kind of wave in the atmosphere. Air cools at the crest of the wave, and the water vapor it contains condenses into clouds.
