This Oct. 4, 2017, illustration shows a hypothetical uneven ring of dust orbiting KIC 8462852, also known as Boyajian’s Star or Tabby’s Star. The star has experienced unusual dips in brightness over a matter of days, as well as much subtler but longer-term dimming trends. Scientists proposed several explanations for this unexpected behavior, ranging from Tabby’s Star swallowing a planet to alien “megastructures” harvesting the star’s energy. However, a study using NASA’s [Spitzer](https://www.nasa.gov/spitzer) and [Swift](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/) missions as well as the Belgian AstroLAB IRIS observatory suggests that the cause of the dimming over long periods is likely an uneven dust cloud moving around the star.

[Learn more about this enigmatic star](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/mysterious-dimming-of-tabbys-star-may-be-caused-by-dust/), named after Tabetha Boyajian, the Yale University postdoc who discovered it with the help of citizen scientists.
