A snowy egret, identifiable by its slender black bill, black legs and yellow feet, marches through a pond near NASAâ€™s Kennedy Space Center, looking for food in this image from March 29, 2007. This species inhabits salt marshes, ponds, rice field and shallow coastal bays from Maine to southern South America. They are also found in northern California, Texas, and Oklahoma. Kennedy shares a boundary with the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, which surrounds it; more than 330 native and migratory bird species live there.
