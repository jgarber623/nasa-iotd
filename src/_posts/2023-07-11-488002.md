A bobcat surveys the landscape at NASA’s [Armstrong Flight Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/home/index.html) in Edwards, California in this March 11, 2021, image. The spotted feline makes its home on the more than 300,000 acres of Mojave Desert surrounding the NASA facility housed at Edwards Air Force Base. Named in honor of Neil A. Armstrong, a former research test pilot at the center and the first man to step on the moon, Armstrong is NASA's primary center for high-risk, atmospheric flight research and test projects.
