On Aug. 21, 2024, engineers and technicians deployed and tested NASA’s [Europa Clipper](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/europa-clipper/) giant solar arrays. Each array measures about 46.5 feet (14.2 meters) long and about 13.5 feet (4.1 meters) high.

Europa Clipper is scheduled to launch Oct. 10, 2024, on the first [mission](https://europa.nasa.gov/mission/about/) to conduct a detailed science investigation of Jupiter’s moon Europa. Scientists predict Europa has a salty ocean beneath its icy crust that could hold the building blocks necessary to sustain life.
