In this image from July 18, 2023, a NASA team helps attach solar arrays for the agency’s [Psyche spacecraft](https://www.nasa.gov/psyche) onto a stand inside the Astrotech Space Operations Facility near Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The solar arrays are part of the solar electric propulsion system, provided by Maxar Technologies. They will power the spacecraft on its journey to explore a metal-rich asteroid.

Psyche is scheduled to lift off at 10:38 a.m. EDT on Thursday, Oct. 5, on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy.
