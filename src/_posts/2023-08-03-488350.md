United Arab Emirates astronaut Sultan Alneyadi captured this image of the city lights of Baghdad, Iraq, and the Tigris River on July 18, 2023, as the International Space Station orbited 261 miles above the Middle Eastern nation. Since the station became operational in November 2000, crew members have produced hundreds of thousands of images of the land, oceans, and atmosphereÂ of Earth, and even of the Moon through [Crew Earth Observations](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/station-science-101/earth-observation/). Their photographs of Earth record how the planet changes over time due to human activity and natural events.
