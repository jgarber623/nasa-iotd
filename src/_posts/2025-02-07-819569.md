The full moon rises over the Superdome and the city of New Orleans, Louisiana on Monday evening, January 13, 2025.

New Orleans is home to [NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility](https://www.nasa.gov/michoud-assembly-facility/) where several pieces of hardware for the SLS (Space Launch system) are being built. For more than half a century, NASA Michoud has been “America’s Rocket Factory,” the nation’s premiere site for manufacturing and assembly of large-scale space structures and systems.
