The SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft, named Freedom, is seen as it approaches the International Space Station with four [Axiom Mission 2](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/axiom-space-private-astronauts-headed-to-international-space-station) private astronauts aboard on Monday, May 22, 2023.  
  
11 crew members are living aboard the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html) with four spaceships now docked to the orbiting lab. Two SpaceX Dragon crew ships are docked adjacent to each other on the stationâ€™s [Harmony module](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/harmony) after the arrival of Axiom Mission 2 aboard Dragon on Monday at 9:12 a.m. EDT. The four private astronauts from Axiom Space opened the Dragon's hatch at 11 a.m. and entered the station, beginning eight days of docked operations.  

The private quartet consisting of Commander Peggy Whitson, Pilot John Shoffner, and Mission Specialists Ali Alqarni and Rayyanah Barnawi spent Tuesday getting familiar with station operations. They practiced preparing food and drinks, conducting hygiene practices, performing safety procedures, and operating lab equipment while getting used to living in space.
