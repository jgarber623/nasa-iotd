Astronaut [David R. Scott](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/scott_david.pdf?emrc=65ea0055cace6), command module pilot for the [Apollo 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG6lWYAFeCQ) Earth-orbital mission, stands in the command module’s open hatch during his stand-up spacewalk on March 6, 1969. Astronaut [Russell L. Schweickart](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/schweickart_russell.pdf?emrc=65ea0055cae38), lunar module pilot, took this photograph of Scott [while also performing a spacewalk](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/astronaut-russell-schweickart-apollo-9-spacewalk/). He was positioned on the porch of the lunar module (LM), while astronaut [James A. McDivitt](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/correction-apollo-astronaut-james-mcdivitt-dies-at-age-93/), was inside the LM.

Apollo 9 was the first crewed flight of the command/service module along with the lunar module. The mission’s three-person crew [tested several aspects critical to landing on the Moon](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/apollo/apollo-9-mission-details/) including the lunar module’s engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems, and docking maneuvers. Apollo 9 set the stage for the next step — Apollo 10 — a test mission that occurred about 70 miles above the Moon’s surface.
