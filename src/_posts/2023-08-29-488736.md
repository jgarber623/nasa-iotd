Rocky Garcia and Wesley James prepare a weather balloon to collect wind data at NASAâ€™s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, on July 20, 2023. Researchers measured wind at altitudes below 2,000 feet using drones, sensors, weather balloons, and other technology during the [Advanced Exploration of Reliable Operation at Low Altitudes: Meteorology, Simulation and Technology campaign](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-armstrong-supports-wind-study). This information could fill knowledge gaps to resolve wind and weather unknowns that could hinder Advanced Air Mobility flights and to improve weather forecasts.
