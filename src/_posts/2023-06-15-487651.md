The European Service Module for the Artemis II Orion spacecraft moves into the Final Assembly and System Testing Cell at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in this image from May 22, 2023. Here, teams are performing final checkouts on the service module, which will fuel and propel Orion in space, before integrating it with the crew module. After, the crew and service modules will be handed over to NASA's Exploration Ground Systems for fueling.
