A Terrier-Improved Orion sounding rocket carrying students experiments for the RockOn! mission successfully launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility Aug. 17 at 6 a.m. EDT. The launch carried experiments for Cubes in Space, RockOn!, and RockSat-C student programs.Â The sounding rocket reached an altitude of 103 miles (116.7 kilometers) before descending back down into the Atlantic Ocean via parachute. Teams will review the payload to return the experiments back to the students.
