Clouds of white vapor pile up at NASA’s [Stennis Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/stennis/) in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, during a full-duration, 500-second hot fire of an [RS-25 certification engine](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/sls_rs25_engine_fs_508.pdf?emrc=65bca517cd97e) Jan. 17, 2024. This test series is critical for future flights of NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket in support of the [Artemis](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/) campaign.

During the [Jan. 17 test](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-continues-artemis-moon-rocket-engine-tests-with-1st-hot-fire-of-2024/), operators followed a “test like you fly” approach, firing the engine for the same amount of time – almost eight-and-a-half minutes (500 seconds) – needed to launch SLS and at power levels ranging between 80% to 113%.
