In this image from July 24, 2023, astronaut [Frank Rubio](https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/frank-rubio) completes a session on the Surface Avatar Remote Control Terminal, which investigates how haptic controls, user interfaces, and virtual reality could command and control surface-bound robots from long distances. While aboard the International Space Station, Rubio has worked on several experiments involving robotics, space physics, and biology, and he participated in three [spacewalks](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/spacewalks/).

On Sept. 11, 2023, Rubio surpassed NASA’s single spaceflight record of 355 continuous days in space made by astronaut Mark Vande Hei on March 30, 2022. NASA TV broadcast a [prerecorded space-to-ground conversation Vande Hei had with Rubio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pis4aDk0Gwk) on Sept. 5, when he congratulated the orbiting astronaut for his record-breaking mission. Rubio is set to return to Earth on Sept. 27, when he will have spent 371 days in space.
