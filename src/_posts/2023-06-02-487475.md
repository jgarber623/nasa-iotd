U.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón reads her [poem for the Europa Clipper mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgWbeDNPD6o) during an event with NASA, Thursday, June 1, 2023, at the Library of Congress in Washington.

The original poem, entitled “In Praise of Mystery: A Poem for Europa,” connects two water worlds – Earth and [Europa](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/europa/in-depth/). The poem will be engraved on a plaque carried aboard the Europa Clipper spacecraft as part of NASA’s ["Message in a Bottle" campaign](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-invites-public-to-sign-poem-that-will-fly-aboard-europa-clipper), which invites people around the world to sign their names to the poem that will journey to another world. Participants’ names will travel 1.8 billion miles (2.89 billion kilometers) aboard the Europa Clipper spacecraft, set to launch in October 2024, on its voyage to Jupiter and its moons.
