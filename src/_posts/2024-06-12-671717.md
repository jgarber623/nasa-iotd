ESA (European Space Agency) astronaut [Andreas Mogensen](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/spacex-crew-7/) snapped a photo of the waning gibbous moon from the International Space Station as it soared 260 miles above the Atlantic Ocean near the northeast coast of South America on Sept. 30, 2023.

Waning gibbous is one of eight [moon phases](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/#hds-sidebar-nav-2), occurring after the full moon. The Sun always illuminates half of the Moon while the other half remains dark, but how much we can see of that illuminated half changes as the Moon travels through its orbit. As the Moon begins its journey back toward the Sun, the lighted side appears to shrink, but the Moonâ€™s orbit is simply carrying it out of view from our perspective.
