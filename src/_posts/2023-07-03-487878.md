A full moon was visible behind the [Artemis I](https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-1/)Â SLS (Space Launch System) rocket and [Orion spacecraft](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/orion/index.html) at Launch Complex 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on June 14, 2022. The first in an increasingly complex series of missions, Artemis I tested SLS and Orion as an integrated system prior to crewed flights to the Moon.
