The NASA “meatball” logo, mounted on the [Flight Research Building](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/facilities/hangar/) at [NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland](https://www.nasa.gov/about-glenn-research-center/), peeks through tree leaves in this June 10, 2016, photo. Built in the 1940s, the Flight Research Building, also known as the NASA Glenn Hangar, is a facility large enough to hold numerous aircraft of various sizes. It has been home to many unique and innovative aircraft over the years.
