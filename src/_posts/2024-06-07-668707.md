A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft aboard [launches](https://plus.nasa.gov/video/nasas-boeing-crew-flight-test-launch/) from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, in this image from June 5, 2024. As part of [NASA’s Commercial Crew Program](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html), the flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams aboard.
