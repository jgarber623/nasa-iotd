Local students [take in the sights](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/albums/72177720309277805)—and data—at an [Earth Information Center](https://gis.earthdata.nasa.gov/portal/apps/sites/#/earth-information-center) student engagement event, Friday, June 23, 2023, at NASA Headquarters in Washington. The Earth Information Center is a new immersive experience that combines live data sets with innovative data visualization and storytelling to show visitors how our planet is changing.

The center gives a whole Earth view down to local information, from temperatures in our cities to sea level rise, greenhouse gas emissions to agricultural productivity. Visit this hybrid exhibit [in person](https://gis.earthdata.nasa.gov/portal/apps/sites/#/earth-information-center/pages/visit) at NASA Headquarters in Washington or online.
