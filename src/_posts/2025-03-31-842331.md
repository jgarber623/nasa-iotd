The view is from the ground, looking far upward, to show the full height of the core stage - 212 feet. The inside of the VAB has many platforms and catwalks around the center of the building, which is open.",

Technicians from NASA and primary contractor Amentum join the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket with the stacked solid rocket boosters for the [Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) mission at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on March 23, 2025. The core stage is the largest component of the rocket, standing 212 feet tall and weighing about 219,000 pounds with its engines. The stage is the backbone of the rocket, supporting the launch vehicle stage adapter, interim cryogenic propulsion stage, Orion stage adapter, and the Orion spacecraft.

Artemis II is the first [crewed test flight](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/our-artemis-crew/) under NASA’s Artemis campaign and is another step toward missions on the lunar surface and helping the agency prepare for future human missions to Mars.
