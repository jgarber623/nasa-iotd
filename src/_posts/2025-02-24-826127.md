Tall plumes of white vapor rise from the rocky Venusian surface in this April 19, 1977, artist’s concept. A little over a year later, NASA’s [Pioneer Venus 1](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/pioneer-venus-1/) would launch as the first of a two-spacecraft orbiter-probe combination designed to study the atmosphere of Venus.

The first American spacecraft to orbit Venus, Pioneer Venus 1 used radar to map the surface of Venus. The probe found Venus to be generally smoother than Earth, though with a mountain higher than Mt. Everest and a chasm deeper than the Grand Canyon.

Thanks to exploration by Pioneer Venus 1 and other spacecraft like [Magellan](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/magellan/), [Galileo](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/galileo/), [Cassini](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/), and even the [Parker Solar Probe](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/), we now have a much better view of what [the surface of Venus](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/targetFamily/Venus) looks like.
