Clouds curling around the [full “blue” moon](https://moon.nasa.gov/news/197/super-blue-moons-your-questions-answered/) gives the night sky an eerie feel in this image from Aug. 19, 2024. As seen here, a blue moon is not actually blue; the third full moon in a season with four full Moons is called a “blue” moon.

Another moon will be visible in the sky the morning of Oct. 25: Jupiter’s icy moon [Europa](https://europa.nasa.gov/why-europa/overview/), the destination of NASA’s recently launched [Europa Clipper](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/europa-clipper/), will be easily observable with binoculars on one side of Jupiter by itself.
