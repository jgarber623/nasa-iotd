Clouds of smoke billow out over the surrounding area as the uncrewed [Skylab 1](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/shuttle/f_skylab1.html)/Saturn V space vehicle launches from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on May 14, 1973. The Skylab 1 payload included the major components of the space station: the orbital workshop, Apollo Telescope Mount, multiple docking adapter, and airlock module. The Skylab 2 crew was scheduled to launch to the space station the following day aboard the Apollo Command and Service Module.

Skylab [helped pave the way for permanent operations](https://www.nasa.gov/content/40-years-ago-skylab-paved-way-for-international-space-station) in low-Earth orbit. Over the course of its human occupation from May 25, 1973, to Feb. 8, 1974, three crews visited Skylab, carrying out 270 scientific and technical investigations in the fields of physics, astronomy, and biological sciences. These activities were forerunners of what we do now aboard the International Space Station.
