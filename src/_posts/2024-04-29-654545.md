  "imageAlt": "A clumpy dome of blueish-gray clouds rises about a third of the way from the bottom. Above it, streaky, translucent red wisps brush upward to about halfway up the image. The top half of the image is the black background of space with one prominent, bright white star with Webb’s 8-point diffraction spikes. Additional stars and galaxies are scattered throughout the image, although very few are seen through the thick clouds at bottom, and all are significantly smaller than the largest star.",

This image of part of the Horsehead Nebula, captured by NASA’s [James Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) and released on April 29, 2024, [shows the nebula in a whole new light](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/webb-captures-top-of-iconic-horsehead-nebula-in-unprecedented-detail), capturing the region’s complexity with unprecedented spatial resolution. Located roughly 1,300 light-years away, the nebula formed from a collapsing interstellar cloud of material, and glows because it is illuminated by a nearby hot star. The gas clouds surrounding the Horsehead have already dissipated, but the jutting pillar is made of thick clumps of material and therefore is harder to erode. Astronomers estimate that the Horsehead has about 5 million years left before it too disintegrates.
