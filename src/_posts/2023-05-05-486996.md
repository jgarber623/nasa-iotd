Curtis Flack (left) and Paul von Hardenberg inspect the ice formation on the spinner of an Advanced Air Mobility proprotor model tested in the Icing Research Tunnel at NASAâ€™s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland.

Data from the test will be used by icing researchers to better understand the risks of icing on electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, assisting those who design and certify new aircraft.
