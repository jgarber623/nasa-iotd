President Joe Biden unveiled this image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 during a [White House event on July 11, 2022](https://images.nasa.gov/details-White%20House%20Briefing%20to%20Unveil%20Imagery%20from%20James%20Webb%20Space%20Telescope%20July%2011%202022). One year later, the James Webb Space Telescope has changed the way we see the universe. From [new views of old subjects](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/52439693830/in/photolist-2nVLjwR-2o3hyLq-2nTUfKo-2nTV91f-2oCodxg-2nJZVwp-2oCqzfm-2oCqzf6-2oCkfE9-2nK1gxH) to discoveries on the chemical composition of [exoplanets](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/52862002049/), Webb has helped us gather clues about the origins of our own solar system and beyond.

To celebrate the completion of a successful first year, NASA has released Webb’s image of a [small star-forming region in the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/webb-celebrates-first-year-of-science-with-new-image).
