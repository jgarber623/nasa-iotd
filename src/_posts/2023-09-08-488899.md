Support teams onboard the SpaceX recovery ship MEGAN work to open the hatch of the SpaceX Dragon Endeavour spacecraft shortly after it landed in the Atlantic Ocean on Sept. 4, 2023, with NASA astronauts [Stephen Bowen](https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/stephen-g-bowen) and [Woody Hoburg](https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/warren-hoburg), United Arab Emirates (UAE) astronaut Sultan Alneyadi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev aboard. Bowen, Hoburg, Alneyadi, and Fedyaev are returning after nearly six months in space aboard the International Space Station.

This was the first spaceflight for all members except Bowen. During this expedition, [Hoburg completed his first spacewalk](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/spacewalker-woody-hoburg-rides-the-canadarm2-robotic-arm), Alneyadi became the first UAE astronaut to conduct a spacewalk, and Bowen tied the record for most spacewalks by a U.S. astronaut, also held by Mike Lopez-Alegria, Bob Behnken, Peggy Whitson, and Chris Cassidy.

Watch the crew discuss [their six-month science mission](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/now-home-on-earth-nasa-s-spacex-crew-6-to-discuss-space-science) aboard the International Space Station during a news conference on Tuesday, Sept. 12 at 2:15 p.m. EDT, [live on NASA’s website](https://www.nasa.gov/live).
