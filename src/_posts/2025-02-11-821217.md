Blue mach diamonds from the main engine nozzles and bright exhaust from the solid rocket boosters mark the successful launch of space shuttle Endeavour 25 years ago on Feb. 11, 2000. The STS-99 mission crew – including astronauts from NASA, the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), and the European Space Agency (ESA) – were aboard the shuttle.

This mission saw the deployment of the [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/srtm) mast and the antenna turned to its operation position. After a successful checkout of the radar systems, mapping began less than 12 hours after launch. Crewmembers split into two shifts so they could work around the clock.

Also aboard Endeavour was a student experiment called [EarthKAM](https://www.nasa.gov/stem-content/sally-ride-earthkam-mission/), which took 2,715 digital photos during the mission through an overhead flight-deck window. The NASA-sponsored program lets middle school students select photo targets and receive the images via the Internet.
