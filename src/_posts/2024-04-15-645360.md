NASA’s [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lro/) (LRO) captured the [April 8, 2024, solar eclipse](https://plus.nasa.gov/video/2024-total-solar-eclipse-through-the-eyes-of-nasa/) from hundreds of thousands of miles away. The camera suite aboard the LRO usually retrieves high resolution black and white images of the Moon’s surface; these images provide knowledge of polar illumination conditions, identify potential resources, hazards, and enable safe landing site selection. To take an image of Earth, the LRO has to rapidly rotate to build up the image.
