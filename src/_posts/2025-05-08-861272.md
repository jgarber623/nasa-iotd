In this May 1, 2025, photo taken by fellow NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, [Anne McClain](https://www.nasa.gov/people/anne-c-mcclain/) works near one of the International Space Station’s main solar arrays during a [spacewalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP9LyPsqI_g). During the May 1 spacewalk – McClain’s third and Ayers’ first – the astronaut pair relocated a space station communications antenna and completed the initial mounting bracket installation steps for an International Space Station Rollout Solar Array, or IROSA, that will arrive on a future SpaceX commercial resupply services mission, in addition to some get ahead tasks.
