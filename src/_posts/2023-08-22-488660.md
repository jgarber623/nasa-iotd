[Gateway's](https://www.nasa.gov/gateway/overview) International Habitat (I-Hab) module, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), is the focus of this rendered image from Aug. 18, 2023. I-Hab is one of two of the space station's habitation modules along with HALO, the Habitation and Logistics Outpost. Astronauts will live, conduct research, and prepare for lunar surface missions inside the two living quarters.

I-Hab will also house life support systems and camera equipment that will enhance Gateway’s scientific research capabilities. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s planned contributions include I-HAB’s environmental control and life support system, batteries, thermal control, and imagery components. They will be integrated into the module by ESA prior to launch.

Gateway will be humanity’s first space station in lunar orbit to support NASA’s deep space exploration plans, along with the [Space Launch System](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/index.html) rocket, [Orion](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/orion/index.html) spacecraft, and the Human Landing System that will send astronauts to the Moon.
