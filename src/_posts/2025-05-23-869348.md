Just after sunrise, the waning gibbous moon sets just behind a waving United States flag on March 19, 2025, in this image from [NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility](https://www.nasa.gov/michoud-assembly-facility/) in New Orleans. The waning gibbous moon phase comes after the full moon. As the Moon begins its journey back toward the Sun, the opposite side of the Moon now reflects the Moon’s light. The lighted side appears to shrink, but the Moon’s orbit is simply carrying it out of view from our perspective. The Moon also rises later and later each night.
