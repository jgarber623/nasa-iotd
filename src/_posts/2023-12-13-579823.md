On Aug. 8, 2023, [Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) crew members (from left) Jeremy Hansen, Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman, and Christina Koch took a photo in front of their [Orion](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/meet-nasas-orion-spacecraft/) crew module at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Announcing the crew and continuing work on the [Space Launch System](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/) rocket and Orion are part of the significant steps taken this year toward the agency’s goal of landing the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.
