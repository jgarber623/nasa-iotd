It leaves a trail of fire and billowing clouds of white smoke behind it, which partially obscures some structures around the launchpad. The light reflects on the mirror-like surface of a nearby body of water. The image is delicately framed on the left, right, and bottom by green leaves.",

In this image from Jan. 30, 2024, an uncrewed Cygnus cargo spacecraft launches atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, starting its journey to the International Space Station. Launching from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Cygnus carries 8,200 pounds of [science investigations and cargo](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-science-hardware-on-northrop-grumman-mission-en-route-to-station/) to support dozens of research experiments. This is Northrop Grumman’s 20th cargo flight to the orbiting laboratory.

Watch [NASA+](https://plus.nasa.gov/scheduled-video/coverage-of-the-rendezvous-and-capture-of-the-northrop-grumman-cargo-spacecraft/) for live coverage of Cygnus’s approach to the space station on Feb. 1, 2024, beginning at 2:45 a.m. EST.
