In this Dec. 11, 1963, image, technicians prepare a test subject for studies on the Reduced Gravity Walking Simulator at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. This position meant that a person’s legs experienced only one sixth of their weight, which was the equivalent of being on the Moon’s surface. The simulator was used to study the subject while walking, jumping, or running; it also was used to train [Apollo](https://www.nasa.gov/the-apollo-program/) astronauts for completing tasks in the unfamiliar lunar environment.

The effect was quite realistic. When asked what it was like to land on the Moon, Neil Armstrong replied, “Like Langley.”
