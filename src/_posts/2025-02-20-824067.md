Engineers at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida completed stacking the twin SLS (Space Launch System) solid rocket boosters – seen in this Feb. 19, 2025, photo – inside the Vehicle Assembly Building for the agency’s [Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) crewed test flight around the Moon.

During stacking operations, which [began](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2024/11/20/nasa-stacks-first-artemis-ii-segment-on-mobile-launcher/) Nov. 20, 2024, technicians used a massive overhead crane to lift each booster segment into place on mobile launcher 1, the 380-foot-tall structure used to process, assemble, and launch the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft.
