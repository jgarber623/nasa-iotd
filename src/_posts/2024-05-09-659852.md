This image, released on May 9, 2024, from NASA’s retired [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/spitzer/) shows streams of dust flowing toward the supermassive [black hole](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/anatomy/) at the heart of the Andromeda Galaxy. These dust streams can help explain how black holes billions of times the mass of our Sun can satiate their big appetites but remain “quiet” eaters.

[Read on to learn how data from Spitzer helped shed light on how some black holes consume gas and dust.](https://www.nasa.gov/general/nasa-images-help-explain-eating-habits-of-massive-black-hole/)
