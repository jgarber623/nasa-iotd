On Sept. 5, 1977, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft lifts off atop its Titan/Centaur-6 launch vehicle from Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, now Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, in Florida.

Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, were originally launched to conduct closeup studies of Jupiter and Saturn, Saturn's rings, and the larger moons of the two planets. After [completing these missions and more](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/45-years-ago-voyager-1-begins-its-epic-journey-to-the-outer-planets-and-beyond "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/45-years-ago-voyager-1-begins-its-epic-journey-to-the-outer-planets-and-beyond"), Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to reach interstellar space and is now the farthest human-made object from Earth. Scientists think it will reach the inner edge of the Oort Cloud in 300 years.
