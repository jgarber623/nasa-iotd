The last names of the crew – Wiseman, Glover, Koch, and Hansen – are written along the patch’s bottom left corner. The Earth and Moon are visible on the patch, reminiscent of the famous “Earthrise” photo. A red line curves through the lines of a letter “A,” then around the Moon and Earth. Next to the “A” are two lines that look like the Roman numeral “I”: this represents Artemis II.",

The [four astronauts](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/our-artemis-crew/) who will be the first to fly to the Moon under NASA’s Artemis campaign have designed an emblem to represent their mission that references both their distant destination and the home they will return to. The crew unveiled their patch in this April 2, 2025, photo.

The crew explained the patch’s symbolism, and its play on the abbreviation of [Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) to AII, with the following description: _The Artemis II test flight begins when a mighty team launches the first crew of the Artemis generation. This patch designates the mission as “AII,” signifying not only the second major flight of the Artemis campaign, but also an endeavor of discovery that seeks to explore for all and by all. Framed in Apollo 8’s famous Earthrise photo, the scene of the Earth and the Moon represents the dual nature of human spaceflight, both equally compelling: The Moon represents our exploration destination, focused on discovery of the unknown. The Earth represents home, focused on the perspective we gain when we look back at our shared planet and learn what it is to be uniquely human. The orbit around Earth highlights the ongoing exploration missions that have enabled Artemis to set sights on a long-term presence on the Moon and soon, Mars._

Commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialist Christina Koch from NASA, and mission specialist Jeremy Hansen from CSA (Canadian Space Agency), will venture around the Moon in 2026 on Artemis II. The 10-day flight will test NASA’s foundational human deep space exploration capabilities, the SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, for the first time with astronauts. Through Artemis, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars.
