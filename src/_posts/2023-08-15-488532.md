On August 8, 2023, the [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) on NASA’s [Aqua](http://aqua.nasa.gov/) satellite captured this image of dense plumes of smoke streaming from dozens of large fires in the Northwest Territories. Several of these fires raged around Yellowknife, the province’s capital and largest city, where firefighters are conducting controlled burns around the city’s perimeter as a cautionary measure. These fires follow major outbreaks of fire in [Alberta](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151313/fires-scorch-western-canada), [British Columbia](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151578/fires-rage-in-british-columbia), [Nova Scotia](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151407/raging-fires-in-nova-scotia), and [Quebec](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151433/smoke-smothers-the-northeast), in May, June, and July.
