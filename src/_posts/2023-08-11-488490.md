This artist’s concept from July 11, 1969, depicts the Apollo 11 lunar module Eagle landing on the surface of the Moon.

Apollo 11 launched from Cape Kennedy on July 16, 1969, carrying commander Neil Armstrong, command module pilot Michael Collins, and lunar module pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin. On July 20, the Eagle landed in the Sea of Tranquility with Aldrin and Armstrong inside, about four miles downrange from the predicted touchdown point and almost one-and-a-half minutes earlier than scheduled. Four hours later, [Armstrong emerged from the Eagle and deployed the TV camera](https://youtu.be/S9HdPi9Ikhk) for the transmission of the event to Earth.
