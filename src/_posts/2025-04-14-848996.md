Thin, pale-blue wisps of clouds fill the background while denser areas of pinkish clouds appear stacked upon the wispier clouds. Thousands of orange stars are visible in the background behind the clouds of the nebula.",

This new image, released on April 4, 2025, showcases the dazzling young star cluster NGC 346. Although both the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/general/nasas-webb-captures-an-ethereal-view-of-ngc-346/) and the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/young-stars-sculpt-gas-with-powerful-outflows/) have released images of NGC 346 previously, this image includes new data and is the first to combine Hubble observations made at infrared, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths into an intricately detailed view of this vibrant star-forming factory.

Hubble’s exquisite sensitivity and resolution were instrumental in [uncovering the secrets](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasas-hubble-finds-spiraling-stars-providing-window-into-early-universe/) of NGC 346’s star formation. Using two sets of observations taken 11 years apart, researchers traced the motions of NGC 346’s stars, revealing them to be spiraling in toward the center of the cluster. This spiraling motion arises from a stream of gas from outside of the cluster that fuels star formation in the center of the turbulent cloud.
