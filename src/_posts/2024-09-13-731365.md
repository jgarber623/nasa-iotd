An astronaut aboard the International Space Station snapped this picture of the Moon as the station orbited 265 miles above the U.S. state of Minnesota on Dec. 17, 2021.

Astronauts aboard the orbital lab take images using handheld digital cameras, usually through windows in the station’s cupola, for [Crew Earth Observations](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/station-science-101/earth-observation/). Crew members have produced hundreds of thousands of images of the Moon and Earth’s land, oceans, and atmosphere.

On Saturday, Sept. 14, 2024, [International Observe the Moon Night](https://moon.nasa.gov/observe-the-moon-night/about/overview/), everyone on Earth is invited to learn about lunar science, participate in [celestial observations](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/viewing-guide/), and honor cultural and personal connection to the Moon.
