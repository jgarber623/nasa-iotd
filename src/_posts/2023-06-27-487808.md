A young alligator rests on a concrete structure at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on April 25, 2023. Alligator breeding season starts in May when males begin courting females. By June, pairs have mated, and females build vegetation nests in the marsh. Eggs hatch in about 65 days. The mother carries her young to the water and protects them from predators, including male alligators.

The center shares a border with the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge. More than 330 native and migratory bird species, 25 mammal, 117 fish, and 65 amphibian and reptile species call Kennedy and the wildlife refuge home.
