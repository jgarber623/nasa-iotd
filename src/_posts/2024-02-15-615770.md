At 1:05 a.m. EST on Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024, [Intuitive Machines’ Nova-C lunar lander, named Odysseus, lifted off](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-artemis-science-first-intuitive-machines-flight-head-to-moon/) on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. As part of NASA’s [Commercial Lunar Payload Services](https://www.nasa.gov/clps) (CLPS) initiative and Artemis campaign, Intuitive Machines’ first lunar mission will carry [NASA science](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/clps/six-nasa-instruments-will-fly-to-moon-on-intuitive-machines-lander/) to the Moon to study plume-surface interactions, space weather/lunar surface interactions, radio astronomy, precision landing technologies, and a communication and navigation node for future autonomous navigation technologies.

Odysseus is scheduled to [land on the Moon’s South Pole region](https://external.jsc.nasa.gov/clps-landing-sites) near the lunar feature known as Malapert A on Thursday, Feb. 22. This relatively flat and safe region is within the otherwise heavily cratered southern highlands on the side of the Moon visible from Earth. Landing near Malapert A will also help mission planners understand how to communicate and send data back to Earth from a location where Earth is low on the lunar horizon.
