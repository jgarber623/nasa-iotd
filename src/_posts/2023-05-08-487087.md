Popocatépetl, one of Mexico’s most active volcanoes, has been erupting since 2005. On April 14, 2023, when this image was acquired by [Landsat 8](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/landsat-8/), monitoring systems detected water vapor, volcanic gases, and ash coming from the volcano. Plumes rose as high as 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers).
