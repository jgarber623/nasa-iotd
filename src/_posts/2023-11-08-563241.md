The sounding rocket is a bright white streak, leaving from a snow-covered ground and moving from bottom left to upper right. A small break in the streak represents the first stage of the rocket burning out and the second stage igniting. A soft, green aurora frames the edges of the image, with many white stars speckled through the black sky. A bright green line toward the top of the frame is a lidar beam. A fisheye lens was used for the photograph, creating a curve for the ground and lidar beam.",

A sounding rocket launched from Poker Flat Research Range in Fairbanks, Alaska, Nov. 8, 2023, carrying NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center’s DISSIPATION mission. The rocket launched into aurora and successfully captured data to understand how auroras heat the atmosphere and cause high-altitude winds. 

The teams continue to support a second sounding rocket launch for BEAM-PIE, a mission for Los Alamos National Laboratory that will use an electron beam to create radio waves, measuring how atmospheric conditions modulate them. The data is key to interpreting measurements from many other missions. 

NASA’s [Sounding Rockets Program](https://www.nasa.gov/soundingrockets), funded by NASA’s [Heliophysics](https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/) Division, is managed at the agency’s [Wallops Flight Facility](https://www.nasa.gov/wallops/) in Virginia, under [NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/) in Greenbelt, Maryland.
