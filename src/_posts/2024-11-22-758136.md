The [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) flying aboard NASA’s [Terra](https://terra.nasa.gov/) satellite took this picture of two cyclones near Iceland on Nov. 20, 2006. Though we usually think of cyclones occurring in the tropics, these spiraling storms can also form at mid- and high latitudes. Cyclones at these latitudes are actually fairly common, and they drive much of the Earth’s weather.
