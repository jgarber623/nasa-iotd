A crane lowers the 112-foot-wide (34-meter-wide) steel framework for the [Deep Space Station 23](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/jpl/nasas-new-deep-space-network-antenna-has-its-crowning-moment/) (DSS-23) reflector dish into position on Dec. 18, 2024, at the [Deep Space Network’s](https://www.nasa.gov/communicating-with-missions/dsn/) (DSN) Goldstone Space Communications Complex near Barstow, California. Once online in 2026, DSS-23 will be the fifth of six new beam waveguide antennas to be added to the network; DSS-23 will boost the DSN’s capacity and enhance NASA’s deep space communications capabilities for decades to come.

The DSN allows missions to track, send commands to, and receive scientific data from faraway spacecraft. More than 100 NASA and non-NASA missions rely on the DSN and Near Space Network, including supporting astronauts aboard the International Space Station and future Artemis missions, supporting lunar exploration, and uncovering the solar system and beyond.
